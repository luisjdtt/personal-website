        I'm a software developer from Mexico, fluent in both Spanish and
        English. With extensive experience in full-stack development, I've
        worked across various technologies but have a particular affinity for
        React, React Native, and Django. I'm always eager to learn and adapt,
        continuously exploring new tools and frameworks to expand my skill set.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">
        Beyond coding, I have a keen interest in deep learning and am focused on
        enhancing my UX and UI design skills to create more intuitive and
        engaging user experiences. When I'm not at my desk, you can find me
        reading, watching movies, or hitting the pavement for a run.
      </p>
